155,Optimising Supply Chains through Strategic Due Diligence, Regularly interrogating tender responses to drive out risk on risk charges and unnecessary cost profiles to ensure a tender properly falls within anticipated costs whilst not incurring unreasonable risk Agreeing reasonable structures to draw down contingency only for risks that are under effective management
156,Dispute Resolution: Strategies for Procurement Contracts and Buyers,Disputes and fear of them can lead to reduced performance and defensive behaviours  Significant projects can be delayed or paused leading to additional costs  They are better tackled swiftly and collaboratively to maintain expected value within the anticipated cost envelope  Throughout my career I have been able to deploy deep contractual understanding applying firm but fair and effective commercial levers together with a creative mindset to get work moving effectivelyAn example is a contract where the supplier had completed more fit outs than required in phase 1 which was good but it had an unforeseen impact on the SLA leading to service credits that were damaging and not truly reflective of their good work   This led to a down tools situation that had serious repercussions which I remedied through in depth contractual review and analysis
157,Contract Value Recovery: Analysis and Optimisation,Typically 9 of the value of every contract is lost sometimes moreI have extensive experience of managing the delivery of contractual benefits This addresses issues including   Delivery not timely Change requests management to get to the anticipated result Correct application and design of SLAs Working with buying staff to align the supplier to the anticipated responsibility Managing and developing supplier subcontractors  
158,Reviving Stalled Contracts: Strategies and Support,A common area for dispute is around waterfall v agile projects  When is it reasonable for a supplier to seek further or additional payment  How can you secure a complete project without a blank cheque for suppliers when the exact specification will evolve  This problem led to my construction of a carefully monitored hybrid approach consisting of stand alone phases that could be implemented each establishing value for money and achieving milestone acceptance and payment with reasonable retention to ensure the overall project succeeded but with enough flexibility assessed at each milestone to ensure necessary adaptability to meet the emerging scope
159,Pre-Post Contract Optimisation for Maximum Efficiency,For many years I have used an evaluation methodology that I first learned from an American company to swiftly assess a contract before it starts in progress and at contract end  This ensures that everyone understands their obligations the contractual boundaries and how to create added valueUnless the contract is regularly reviewed it is very easy for obligations to go unenforced  This means that the value included in the contract is not maximisedAn example recently was a suppliers obligation to move to an automated helpdesk service  They were to train the customers in using the service  They did not fully automate and did not therefore train the customer staffThey experienced many more calls to the helpdesk than they expected and sought to apply additional charges  If they had met their obligations there would not have been so many calls and we were able to address that first by allowing extra calls at not cost and then by ensuring the contractual obligation of automation was introduced with appropriate user trainingThis methodology can be taught to Procurement teams to help them pinpoint issues preferably before they arise but to quickly resolve them if necessary
160,Strategic Contract Exits: Planning and Execution,When a supplier of a longer term or complex contract is due to leave it is vital to ensure adequate handover  This should be set out in the contract but can often be overlookedThere should be two elements What the supplier is obliged to provide in the contract This may include data room information TUPE provision knowledge transfer etc that will be fundamental to business continuity and there may be optional elements that could be requested It is natural that suppliers will seek to minimise the former and maximise the latterThe Procurement team will need to be very clear on timeframes can the contracts be extended On what terms How long do they have to procure an alternative solution  How to maintain ending the current contract and starting the new one in alignment It is important to understand what information is needed from the supplier in the procurement exercise and what they are obliged to provide  They must be held to account   What is needed to release a tender and what is needed during the contracting period Reasonable cooperation is important and must be facilitated  Often suppliers wish to limit information provided or will seek to have more workers included in TUPE than anticipated  Being poorly prepared for this can end in contracts with the original supplier needing to be temporarily extended allowing the supplier to name its price and this must be avoided Is the same supplier going to be included in the new tender process  It is important to ensure that they do not have an unfair advantage against other bidders perhaps by applying ethical walls etc
161,Navigating Divestments and Acquisitions: A Procurement Perspective,Ive led the divestment of business units and also on the acquisition and start up side eg when De La Rue divested PortalsIt is important to understand what contracts can be transferred and on what basis   eg is it an automatic right is it permitted subject to approval or is the contract silent or even prohibitedIt is important to assess this and to do that it is necessary to have all contracts to hand which is often not the case  As such there must be an exercise to identify all spend and whom the spend is made with  It is also important that there are no disputes ongoing as these will be offputting to acquirersEarly in my career I saw disputes being settled to a suppliers benefit solely so that they would not be visible to potential acquirers which is not optimal  Once that information is obtained it will become clear as to what procurement activities may be needed together with what information may be required to be included in data room for possible acquirersOn acquisition it may be really important to plug some gaps in supply and to do this without allowing suppliers to find out that their services are considered mission critical which would be price affecting  It may also be useful to explore on acquisition side what governance should be immediately put in place in respect of supplier contracts  is it worth having a digital contract management solution for example
162,Contractual Frameworks for Start-Ups: Building Solid Foundations,Procurement strategy should be established prior to trading wherever possible  This was imperative in the joint venture I led between Royal Marsden ICR and Sopra SteriaThe kinds of areas I can guide you on are Firstly do you have enough of the right experience to get this done in a timely way Do you need to hireretrainexit anyone in the Procurement team Can you buy off the shelf  Is anything niche  What sort of volumes will you need Are you seeking to have intellectual property ownership Do the existing relationships include any supply expectations What is your budget How are you going to benchmark the pricing What is mission critical  What can wait What licensing model do you want eg enterprise wide or named user How do you generate bids for work  Do you use any existing frameworks or are there key suppliers in the industry that you should form relationships with Will you have exec sponsors for key relationships What resilience do you have  This will vary depending on how easy it will be to replace a supplier What due diligence will you require on your suppliers and their suppliers  Are you confident that they can meet your expectations  What reassurance do you require  Parent Company Guaranteeinsurance etc What policies do you have that you will require adherence to  You will probably have to publish them  eg data protection antimoney laundering anti modern slavery etc What will your supplier governance look like Do you have capacity to execute it What tools can you adopt to reduce effortFailure to set this up well in the beginning could severely impact your ability to deliver expected results in early years of trading  This could lead to the failure of the new venture
163,Incorporating Social Value into Procurement Tenders, Coauthored a paper on this topic for World Commerce and Contracting with public sector Procurement experts Our research showed that often social value is added as a tick box exercise whereas to glean true value for both parties and the community this must receive adequate and ongoing consideration By working on social value together true partnership can be established that leads to better cooperation in other matters  Demonstrating that this is done well can help to attract the best talent to your organisationAddressing the following considerations can bring immense value  For example What social value compliments your strategy Could you bring a few suppliers together to produce an outcome greater than the sum of the parts How are you going to measure the contribution in a tender Who will ensure the social value is achieved in your organisation What reporting is in place Who is going to work on this both buy side and supplier side Unless someone is specificially responsible it wont be done  Are you paying for this by way of hidden charges in the suppliers proposal  How do you draw that out What sort of publicity of the social value do you want to generate What are the arrangements in place for this with the chosen supplier What is the programme of work specifically in relation to the social value element do you require How do you document this in the best manner
164,Handling Employee Disciplinary: A Procurement Leader’s Guide,Procurement teams operate in a position of fiduciary responsibility  It is important that they are above reproach and that they understand the required behaviours  for example what is acceptable in terms of corporate hospitality offered by suppliersEducation in this area is paramount  It is also important that Procurement teams have a good understanding of the law in matters relating to competition law in particularThis is important to help employees to do great work but it is also vital to be able to use this if it is suspected that an employees behaviour falls below the required standards which may even amount to criminal behaviourI have led investigations into suspicious activities ensuring that the evidence is gathered professionally and comprehensively I have been the Officer in charge of many disciplinary hearings some of which have led to onthespot termination of employment at the end of the Hearing Managing these effectively is key to ensure no employer can bring a successful unfair dismissal claim as due process is carefully adhered toI have led investigations that have properly led to police involvement eg when a procurement officer paid an invoice to a bogus supply account which could have been an inside job or the officer may have simply failed to apply appropriate checksAll these matters are extremely delicate and can have far reaching consequences so they must be handled with utmost confidentiality and as swiftly as possible
